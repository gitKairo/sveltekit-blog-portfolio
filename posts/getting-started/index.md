Hello, and welcome to my portfolio/blog! I'm really excited to have finally finished the first stage of this project and to get to share it with the world.

My name is Kai Ruge. I am a Software Engineer currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Missouri State University. I am specializing in Software Engineering and minoring in Cyber Security. I've always loved tech and learning, and in this field, I always get to work with new cool technologies, products, and a multitude of other things.

This blog will serve as a canvas for my thoughts and, hopefully, a rewarding personal project. You can expect content on the latest tech trends (AI, AI, and maybe AI), as well as things I'm passionate about: Video Games, Film, Content Creation, and just whatever else I feel like including.

Your thoughts, opinions, and perspectives are what will make this journey truly enriching. I encourage you to share your views, challenge ideas, and engage in meaningful discussions. I would love to one day foster a community of curious minds and dope people.

If you'd like to reach out to me, please do so through LinkedIn or my email kairuge4@gmail.com.
